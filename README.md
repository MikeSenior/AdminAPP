# AdminAPP

A JIRA like program for website developers written for my AQA Computing Project 2015.

## Running the server locally

To run this locally, you will need: 

- .NET Framework 3.5
- MySQL Server
- LAMP Stack server for frontend

## Some background

In heinsight I really wished I had made this whole project in PHP.
Learning VB was bad and OOP in VB was bad.
A bad time was had overall.
